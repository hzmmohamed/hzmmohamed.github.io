This post is a reflection onto why and a documentation of how I can empower myself more to take the righteous steps that keep me most alive, even if it\\u2019s scary sometimes to go against the grain.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Kris Baute, being a so-called \\u2018science educator\\u2019 on YouTube, has been shifting his online presence over the last few years to one that heavily carries the issues of climate change seriously to the public. He has strived to cultivate awareness and inspire action and activism. In talk\\u2019s introduction, he told the story of his disillusionment after a lifetime of passionate steps on a path of serving to solve climate change. He ended up with a Master\\u2019s in environmental science, believing all along that solving climate change needed more than anything else better research, better scientific understanding and ingenious solutions. He kept on moving on this path until he realized that reality was quite different.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Simple words he said: \\u201CClimate change is not a science problem\\u201D echoed fiercely in me. It\\u2019s what I\\u2019ve been thinking about for months, experiencing the same revelation and disillusionment in the efficacy of all the hyped technological endeavors that try to address environmental issues by gathering more data and building more apps. I have nothing against these sincere efforts, though some are, really, hollow products of effective marketing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Climate change, and all environmental crises for that matter, are not a science problem, only minimally really, at this point. They are, in fact, deeply political, economic and cultural. They are matters of the models we use to define our economies, which dictate the forces that drive it in turn. They are issues whose future hinges not upon the revolutionary next techno-fix or the billionaire whose money will save the world, but rather on the collective narrative that people choose, either mindfully and actively or not.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The environmental strain that the planet is experiencing is a product of the economic and political system that makes throwing food in the sea the best business decision when it\\u2019s not profitable to store or sell it.

I learned a great deal from this panoramic view, especially regarding historical emissions figures and the deliberate lies that oil companies spread for decades.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Most of all, his presentation and the similarity of his story to mine reignited my determination that an effective contribution to realizing more sustainability relies on social sciences as cornerstones.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I\\u2019m finishing my engineering degree.

I\\u2019m aware that building a career, especially in engineering, is time-consuming and requires a lot of continuous devotion to the technical advancements of a field. Something in me yearns to be with the people, as foreign as that would have sounded to my teenage self.

I read on in some Quora answers that it\\u2019s common to find Data Science professionals that originally had economics backgrounds. It\\u2019s reasonable, as econometrics heavily uses statistics. I\\u2019ll be looking out for stepping stones along this path, where I can enrich my data science expertise, serve a cause in an environmental tech company, and keep learning social sciences along the way. I\\u2019m also grateful that reaching this conclusion still makes me pursue ordinary data scientist/engineer roles.
