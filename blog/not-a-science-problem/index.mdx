Upon watching Kris Baute’s talk this week titled “Why The Rich Must Pay for Climate Change?”, I felt deeply grateful to have come across it at this time of my journey of service, exploring the horizons the stretch bemusingly wide before me. This post is a reflection onto why and a documentation of how I can empower myself more to take the righteous steps that keep me most alive, even if it’s scary sometimes to go against the grain.

Kris Baute, being a so-called ‘science educator’ on YouTube, has been shifting his online presence over the last few years to one that heavily carries the issues of climate change seriously to the public. He has strived to cultivate awareness and inspire action and activism. In talk’s introduction, he told the story of his disillusionment after a lifetime of passionate steps on a path of serving to solve climate change. He ended up with a Master’s in environmental science, believing all along that solving climate change needed more than anything else better research, better scientific understanding and ingenious solutions. He kept on moving on this path until he realized that reality was quite different.

Simple words he said: “Climate change is not a science problem” echoed fiercely in me. It’s what I’ve been thinking about for months, experiencing the same revelation and disillusionment in the efficacy of all the hyped technological endeavors that try to address environmental issues by gathering more data and building more apps. I have nothing against these sincere efforts, though some are, really, hollow products of effective marketing.

Climate change, and all environmental crises for that matter, are not a science problem, only minimally really, at this point. They are, in fact, deeply political, economic and cultural. They are matters of the models we use to define our economies, which dictate the forces that drive it in turn. They are issues whose future hinges not upon the revolutionary next techno-fix or the billionaire whose money will save the world, but rather on the collective narrative that people choose, either mindfully and actively or not.

The environmental strain that the planet is experiencing is a product of the economic and political system that makes throwing food in the sea the best business decision when it’s not profitable to store or sell it. It’s the system that fuels the creation of monopolies and glorifies spiraling business growth even when it entails inequity and exploitation or results in worse lives for people.

Going back to Kris’s talk, I think the points that he laid out regarding the socioeconomic context of climate change from a global perspective was quite enlightening. I learned a great deal from this panoramic view, especially regarding historical emissions figures and the deliberate lies that oil companies spread for decades.

Most of all, his presentation and the similarity of his story to mine reignited my determination that an effective contribution to realizing more sustainability relies on social sciences as cornerstones.

I’m finishing my engineering degree. I’ve long been vehemently in search of opportunities to employ software or data science as drivers for radical transformations regarding environmental and social issues. Doing that, I’ve come across numerous inspiring entities and people striving sincerely to be of service.

However, something in me just won’t settle for building a career where I just might be employed in service of an environmental issue. I’m aware that building a career, especially in engineering, is time-consuming and requires a lot of continuous devotion to the technical advancements of a field. Something in me yearns to be with the people, as foreign as that would have sounded to my teenage self. I want to invest myself in the bigger picture, in pushing decisions to be made, to spread awareness and educate people about the forces that make society how it is, in order to cultivate informed visions for a better, more equitable future. That is truly where change starts.

This post marks a realization that the only path I can see going forward is one that transitions me to the field of economics, public policy and activism. I find that data science is, among the fields I’ve studied and garnered some experience in, the most relevant to my vision. I read on in some Quora answers that it’s common to find Data Science professionals that originally had economics backgrounds. It’s reasonable, as econometrics heavily uses statistics. I’ll be looking out for stepping stones along this path, where I can enrich my data science expertise, serve a cause in an environmental tech company, and keep learning social sciences along the way. I’m also grateful that reaching this conclusion still makes me pursue ordinary data scientist/engineer roles. It’s a blessing to be in this balanced position.
