This is me trying to peek into this reverberating light that landed in my heart, dancing along its unfinished lines extending into unknowns so known to the heart. It took its time since the Global Problem Solvers session a few weeks ago. How its vivacious, yet humbly reverent, energy left a deeply truthful imprint.

What am I doing on this journey of worldly doings? To the extent that I've been blessed to know and feel, one way I see it is simply helping make habitats more humane, sane and beautiful. Urban environments-- their reality is the labyrinthine collision of all the *complex* humans that inhabit them, nature and the built environment.

Going back as early as my first year at college, I can trace a greatly empowering feeling of disenchantment with conventional perception of technology. The orderly nature of the universe is fascinating, to say the least. As enjoyable as it is to dissect technical problems and build more powerful, more elegant tools, I constantly knew that my journey cannot be a lifelong dialogue with bits on computers.I knew I was prone to mistake elegant models for reality when they're truly not. I recall moments of sheer dread thinking there could be virtually no way to channel this elusive energy in a meaningful career.

So much has changed; it's a pathless path now that I tread upon, a timeless one-- how many times plans and keen questions dissolved in the gushing stream of answers. Every step then, feels timelessly familiar to the soul.

Still, that calling for being more of a human (connecting to other humans) than a technologist, echoes on through all the phases.

And so I am writing this reflection, urged by a growing revelation on how much potential real-life human connections hold. A lot of old perceptions of mine have been uprooted by the past few years. After being fixated on the big-picture views, the numbers and stats, and how technologies scale, I have been humbled before the complexity of humans in a system. I have seen the immense value of simply communicating ideas, of co-creating culture by participating, not seeking control. *All change starts with a change of heart.* Tools are enablers, they are means to ends. How much modern culture obsesses about the superficial, about the means over the essential ends.

My heart can somehow touch a part of the journey yet to arrive. It feels inevitable to be out there, sparking conversation with people about perceptions of the places we live in. I see eye-opening sharing, humbling empathy, admirable originality and creativity. I see webs of sincere connections growing and strengthening around the realness of the land we tread and the air we breathe.

Now I see how sharing ideas-- to actually *talk* with people that may not get what you say at first-- is extremely important work.
